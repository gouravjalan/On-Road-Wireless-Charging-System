# On-Road-Wireless-Charging-System
This is a B.Tech project developed at DKTEâ€™s Textile and Engineering Institute. It uses electromagnetic induction to charge electric vehicles wirelessly while in motion, using Arduino, IR sensors, relays, and copper coils. Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) can increase the driving range of EVs by charging EVs in motion when they drive.
